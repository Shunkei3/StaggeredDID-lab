# Staggered DiD study group

Code repository for exploring and learning staggered DID methods.


+ Extended TWFE: see `Code/TWM_learning.qmd`
+ CS-DID: see `Code/Sim_CS_DID.qmd`
+ *Replication for Baker et al. (2022)'s simulation*: see `Code/Sim_Baker_et_al_2022.qmd`
  + Using their simulation framework, I compare the performance of the CS-DID and the extended TWFE.
